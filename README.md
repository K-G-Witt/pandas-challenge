## Project Description:
This project contains two separate .csv files:

1. **schools_complete:**
Reports data on school names, types (i.e., Government vs. Independent), student size, and annual budget for 15 high schools within the Local Government Area (LGA).

2. **students_complete:**
Reports data on the student name, year level, reading score, and math score for the 39,169 students attending these 15 high schools within the Local Government Area (LGA).


## Installation and Run Instructions:
These two .csv files need to be merged together by executing the script provided in the **PyCitySchools_AnalysisCode** Jupyter Lab Notebook.


## Usage Instructions:
Following this, executing the script provided in the **PyCitySchools_AnalysisCode** Jupyter Lab Notebook will also output the following information:

**At the Local Government Area (LGA) level:**
1. Total number of unique schools;
2. Total number of students;
3. Total budget;
4. Average maths score;
5. Average reading score;
6. Percentage of students passing maths;
7. Percentage of students passing reading;
8. Percentage of students passing overall (i.e., passing both maths and reading).

**At the school level:**
1. School names;
2. School types (i.e., Government vs. Independent);
3. Total number of students;
4. Total school budget;
5. Per student budget;
6. Average maths score;
7. Average reading score;
8.  Percentage of students passing maths;
9. Percentage of students passing reading;
10. Percentage of students passing overall (i.e., passing both maths and reading);
11. Top 5 highest performing schools (by overall passing rate);
12. Bottom 5 worst performing schools (by overall passing rate);
13. Maths scores by year level;
14. Reading scores by year level;
15. School performance by average spending range (per student);
16. School performance by school size range;
17. School performance by school type.
